[bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js) is a library for
functional reactive programming. Or let’s say it’s a library for working
with events and dynamic values (which are called Properties in
Bacon.js). [Check out](http://raimohanska.github.io/bacon.js-slides/)
the interactive demo.

    npm install baconjs

Conal Elliot explains functional reactive programming (FPR) over at
[Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028250/what-is-functional-reactive-programming/1030631#1030631):

>     continuously over time.

>     “events”, each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of
>     occurrences. Each occurrence has an associated time and value.

There are plenty of examples and information on the [github
