[baconjs][browsenpm] (Github: [baconjs/baconjs][github], License: MIT) is a library for
functional reactive programming. Or let’s say it’s a library for working
with events and dynamic values (which are called Properties in
Bacon.js). [Check out](http://raimohanska.github.io/bacon.js-slides/)
the interactive demo.

    npm install baconjs

Conal Elliot explains functional reactive programming (FPR) over at
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028250/what-is-functional-reactive-programming/1030631#1030631):

> -   Behaviors are built up out of a few primitives, like constant
>     (static) behaviors and time (like a clock), and then with
>     sequential and parallel combination. n behaviors are combined by
>     applying an n-ary function (on static values), “point-wise”, i.e.,
>     continuously over time.
>
> -   To account for discrete phenomena, have another type (family) of
>     “events”, each of which has a stream (finite or infinite) of
>     occurrences. Each occurrence has an associated time and value.

>     denotational semantics has two parts, from its two founders

There are plenty of examples and information on the [github page][github].
