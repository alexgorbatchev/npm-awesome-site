<%- @reference() %> is a tiny language and
an engine for selecting specific parts of a JavaScript object.

    npm install json-mask

The use is very straightforward:

    > var mask = require('json-mask')
    > mask({p: {a: 1, b: 2}, z: 1}, 'p/a,z')
    {p: {a: 1}, z: 1}

The main difference between JSONPath / JSONSelect and this engine is
that JSON Mask preserves the structure of the original input object.
Instead of returning an array of selected sub-elements (e.g.
`[{a: 1}, {z: 1}]` from example above), it filters-out the parts of the
object that you don’t need, keeping the structure unchanged:
`{p: {a: 1}, z: 1}`.

This is important because JSON Mask was designed with HTTP resources in
mind, the structure of which I didn’t want to change after the unwanted
fields were masked / filtered.

## Syntax

The syntax is loosely based on XPath:

- `a,b,c` comma-separated list will select multiple fields
- `a/b/c` path will select a field from its parent
- `a(b,c)` sub-selection will select many fields from a parent
- `a/*/c` the star `*` wildcard will select all items in a field
