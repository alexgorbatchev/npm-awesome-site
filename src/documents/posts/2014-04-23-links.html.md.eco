I'm happy to welcome [André König](https://github.com/akoenig) to npmawesome! Very excited to publish his first post about [platform.js](http://npmawesome.com/posts/2014-04-23-platform-js)!

Woot!

* [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) is a Javascript interpreter for .NET. Jint doesn't compile Javascript to .NET bytecode and in this sense might be best suited for projects requiring to run relatively small scripts faster, or which need to run on different platforms.
