[QR code] is this super cool thing you probably have been seeing all over the place lately. It started appearing in North America a few years ago but the actual standard is close to two decades old. It allows you to embed any small amount of data that could be decoded with a basic camera equipped phone. Most common use case here is embedding URLs in printed adverising so that those who are interested could simply point their phone at the add and go to the site instead of having to type in URLs.

<%- @npm() %> is a module by <%- @author() %> to render [QR code] with node.js and no external dependencies.

    <%- @install() %>

## Overview

* No dependecies. This is a really cool bit, if you look at [`package.json`](https://github.com/alexeyten/qr-image/blob/master/package.json) there are literally no dependencies there.
* Generate image in `png`, `svg`, `eps` and `pdf` formats.
* Support UTF-8.

## Usage

    var qr = require('qr-image');
    var fs = require('fs');

    var code = qr.image('http://blog.nodejitsu.com', { type: 'svg' });
    var output = fs.createWriteStream('nodejitsu.svg')

    code.pipe(output);

Because we are dealing with streams here, hooking this up to HTTP server is super easy.

    var qr = require('qr-image');
    var express = require('express');

    var app = express();

    app.get('/', function(req, res) {
      var code = qr.image(new Date().toString(), { type: 'svg' });
      res.type('svg');
      code.pipe(res);
    });

    app.listen(3000);

Now, going to `http://localhost:3000` will spit out a QR code with current time. Wicked!

## Metadata

[QR code] allows you embed pretty much any text, but with some additional formatting you can tell scanning applications about the data and what you want them to do with it. Here are a few most common formats:

<div class="overflow"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="10px">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Data Format</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Website URL</th>
      <td>http://www.websitename.com (include the “http://” so it recognizes the data as a website URL)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Pre-populated email address</th>
      <td>mailto:name@email.com (include “mailto” so it recognizes the data as an email address)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Pre-Populated Telephone Number</th>
      <td>+16365553344 (URI should include the country code to support users outside the country of origin)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Contact Information</th>
      <td>LastName,FirstName;ADR:(insert address), (second address line), City, ST (Insert 5-digit zip code);TEL:+16365553344;EMAIL:name@email.com;;<strong>DO NOT</strong> use parenthesis or line breaks in code.<p></p>
        <p>*For QR Codes, the MECARD standard format shown above is more standard than vCard standard format</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Pre-populated SMS Message</th>
      <td>smsto:number:message</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Pre-populated MMS Message</th>
      <td>mms:number:subject</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Map or Location Coordinates</th>
      <td>latitude, longitude, altitude in meters (a minus sign denotes a South latitude and a West longitude)code for Google offices: 40.71872,-73.98905, 100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Android Market URI for Android Devices</th>
      <td>For a QR code you must replace all punctuation with code. For example,market://search?q=pub:”Search Query” becomes:<p></p>
      <p>market://search?q=pub%3A%22Search%20Query%22</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
