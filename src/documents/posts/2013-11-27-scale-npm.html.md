The [NPM](http://npmjs.org) registry recently got crashy, and it was incredibly painful. Here at [Good Eggs](http://www.goodeggs.com) we were affected as much as any other node shop - we couldn't push a build out.

<a href="http://scalenpm.org">scalenpm.org</a> is an effort to fix this problem by throwing some money at it. The plan is to use the money to dedicate extra engineer time and hardware to the repository we all know and love. At the moment of writing the funding reached $115k out of $200k estimated.

For just $75 you get can support NPM aaaaand get a t-shirt! Woot! [Go donate!](https://scalenpm.org/donate)
