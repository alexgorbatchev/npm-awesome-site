[npmd][browsenpm] (Github: [dominictarr/npmd][github], License: MIT) is an alternative npm
client, based around a local replication of the npm metadata
(package.json & readmes are replicated for every package, but only
tarballs that you have installed are replicated). Replicating data
locally makes the client much smarter, and enables all manner of Mad
Science.

    npm install npmd

To begin, replicate the registry metadata. When this gets near 100% you
can use the other commands.

    npmd --sync

You should leave the npmd service running in the background, this will
make running other npmd commands much faster. npmd will pull down npm
metadata, and store it in a leveldb. This will be less than 200mb,
including a full text index.

To publish a module locally from the package directory, just do:

    npmd publish

and your package version will be stashed into a queue for local use. You
can npmd install yourpkg locally even if yourpkg isnâ€™t on the public npm
yet. You can even have multiple versions of your package queued up
locally.

There are plenty of examples and information on the [github
page][github].
