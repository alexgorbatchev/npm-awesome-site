## Articles

* [Error Handling in Node.js](http://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors)
  > Error handling is a pain, and it's easy to get by for a long time in Node.js without dealing with many errors correctly. But building robust Node.js apps requires dealing properly with errors, and it's not hard to learn how.
* [MongoDB and Amazon Web Services: Deploying for High Availability](http://www.slideshare.net/mongodb/mongodb-and-amazon-web-services-deploying-for-high-availability-31642339)
  > Best practices are meant to be a sensible starting point
* [CSS: The Good Parts](http://blog.ponyfoo.com/2014/05/17/css-the-good-parts)
  > This style guide is a jab at solving collisions between CSS class names, and issues that ultimately lead to confusion, having to use !important rules, copying and pasting style declarations, and other awful aspects of CSS developments.
* [Emulators written in JavaScript](http://www.cambus.net/emulators-written-in-javascript/)
  > This list started as a compilation of JavaScript emulators posted to Echo JS over the years.
* [Develop a NodeJS App With Docker](http://blog.abhinav.ca/blog/2014/06/17/develop-a-nodejs-app-with-docker/)

* [Candy Japan crosses $10000 MRR](http://www.candyjapan.com/candy-japan-crosses-10000-mrr)
  > Out of that $10k / month revenue of course not all (not even most) is profit. Compared to a SaaS, the costs are very high, but I've carved enough profit margin to reach an income level similar to a Japanese salaryman now.
