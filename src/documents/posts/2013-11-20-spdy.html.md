[spdy](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy) lets you create [SPDY
servers](http://www.chromium.org/spdy) in node.js with natural http
module interface and fallback to regular https (for browsers that don’t
support SPDY yet).

    npm install spdy

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY):

> The goal of SPDY is to reduce web page load time. This is achieved by
> prioritizing and multiplexing the transfer of web page subresources so
> that only one connection per client is required. TLS encryption is
> nearly ubiquitous in SPDY implementations, and transmission headers
> are gzip-or DEFLATE-compressed by design (in contrast to HTTP, where
> the headers are sent as human-readable text). Moreover, servers may
> hint or even push content instead of awaiting individual requests for
> each resource of a web page.

Here’s how you would use it with express:

    var spdy = require('spdy'),
        express = require('express'),
        fs = require('fs');

    var options = {
      key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-cert.pem'),
      ca: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-ca.pem'),

      // SPDY-specific options
      windowSize: 1024 // Server's window size
    };

    var app = express();
    app.use(/* your favorite middleware */);
    var server = spdy.createServer(options, app);
    server.listen(443);

There are plenty of examples and information on the [github
page](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy).
