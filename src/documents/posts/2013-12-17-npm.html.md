NPM v1.3.18 release notes:

* Added an `--ignore-scripts` option, which will prevent package.json scripts from being run. Most notably, this will work on npm install, so e.g. npm install `--ignore-scripts` will not run preinstall and prepublish scripts. ([d7e67bf](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commit/d7e67bf0d94b085652ec1c87d595afa6f650a8f6), @sqs)

* Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.16 that would manifest with certain cache configurations, by causing spurious errors saying "Adding a cache directory to the cache will make the world implode." ([966373f](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commit/966373fad8d741637f9744882bde9f6e94000865), @domenic)

* Re-fixed the multiple download of URL dependencies, whose fix was reverted in 1.3.17. ([a362c3f](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commit/a362c3f1919987419ed8a37c8defa19d2e6697b0), @spmason)
