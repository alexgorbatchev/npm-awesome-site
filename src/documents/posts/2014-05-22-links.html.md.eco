## Articles

* [Add Rules to Stylesheets with JavaScript](http://davidwalsh.name/add-rules-stylesheets)
  > Another way we can make our pages efficient and fast is to dynamically add and remove styles directly to a stylesheet instead of constantly querying the DOM for elements and applying styles.  Here's how it works!
* [Redis new data structure: the HyperLogLog](http://antirez.com/news/75)
  > There is a class of algorithms that use randomization in order to provide an approximation of the number of unique elements in a set using just a constant, and small, amount of memory. The best of such algorithms currently known is called HyperLogLog, and is due to Philippe Flajolet.
* [Script-injected "async scripts" considered harmful](https://www.igvita.com/2014/05/20/script-injected-async-scripts-considered-harmful/)

And with the recent release of Internet Explorer 11 and Safari 6.1, the latest Flexbox spec is now supported in every modern browser.
