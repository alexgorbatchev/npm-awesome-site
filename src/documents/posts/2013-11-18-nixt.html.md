[nixt](https://github.com/vesln/nixt) is aiming to make testing of
command-line apps as simple as possible. It plays nice with the testing
tools that you are already using and in case you are one of those guys
who practice outside-in BDD, it has the potential to become something
that lives in every command-line app that you are going to build.

    npm install nixt

The use is very straightforward:

    describe('todo add', function() {
      it('adds a new todo item', function(done) {
        nixt()
          .run('todo add')
          .stdout('A new todo has been added')
          .end(done);
      });
    });

There are plenty of examples and information on the [github
page](https://github.com/vesln/nixt).
