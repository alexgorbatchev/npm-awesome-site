## Articles & Slides

* [Write Code Every Day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)

  > Minimum viable code. I was forced to write code for no less than 30 minutes a day. (It’s really hard to write meaningful code in less time, especially after remembering where you left off the day before.) Some week days I work a little bit more (usually no more than an hour) and on weekends I’m sometimes able to work a full day.

* [Docker-powered Runnable Gists](http://hmarr.com/2013/oct/16/codecube-runnable-gists/)

  > There are a number of ways of achieving each of these objectives (virtual machines, chroot, cgroups, etc), but Docker emerged as a pretty great solution that covers each of the points mentioned. Built on LXC and cgroups, it enables creation and teardown of relatively secure sandboxed environments in a fraction of a second. Each time a code snippet is run, a docker container can be created, started, used to run the untrusted code, then killed and destroyed. It’s incredible that all this can happen in a matter of milliseconds.

* [JS Everywhere - My First Conference Talk](http://blog.dcxn.com/2013/10/27/js-everywhere-my-first-conference-talk/)

  > I started working on this 15-minute talk about a month ago and that felt like the right amount of time. The talk went through several incarnations as I got feedback from a number of different people. Fairly early on I knew that I wanted to argue that code is fashion but in early talks, someone pointed out to me that I was really saying that fashion is nothing but fads. That was great feedback and because I still had quite a bit of time I was able to think about it and come to a better understanding of what fashion means to me.

* [Debugging Clustered Apps with Node-Inspector](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/whats-new-nodejs-v0-12-debugging-clusters/)

  > Debugging a clustered Node application is not without some idiosyncrasies, particularly if you are running Node v0.10. But, it does work well enough if you understand what’s going on behind the scenes. Now, before you embark on this debugging adventure, you should probably ask yourself, “Can I run my app un-clustered and debug it in that mode or is the issue I am trying to track down, only seen when running my app in a clustered configuration?”

* [Why are people from the future not time traveling to our period?](http://www.quora.com/Time-Travel/Why-are-people-from-the-future-not-time-traveling-to-our-period)

  > ![](http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aff38ac936d19039781773b5bdbac2d4?convert_to_webp=true)
  >
  > So the likely reason that time travelers from the future aren't visiting our period is (other than time travel perhaps being physically impossible) that we're just not that interesting, and we're not really that large.  It's only temporal-centric egotism that makes us believe otherwise.
